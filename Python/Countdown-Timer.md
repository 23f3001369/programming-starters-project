# Countdown Timer in Python

Welcome to the Countdown Timer project for Python! ⏲️

In this project, we'll create a simple countdown timer using Python. This project is great for learning about time manipulation and creating a practical application. Let's get started!

## Project Overview

### Objective

Create a Python script that functions as a countdown timer.

### Features

- Allow the user to set the duration of the countdown.
- Display the countdown in seconds.
- Notify the user when the countdown reaches zero.

## Project Structure

Create a new Python script named `countdown_timer.py`.

## Instructions

1. **Get User Input:**
   - Prompt the user to enter the duration of the countdown in seconds.

2. **Countdown Display:**
   - Display the countdown in seconds, updating every second.

3. **Notification:**
   - Notify the user when the countdown reaches zero. You can use a sound alert or a simple console message.

4. **Run the Script:**
   - Execute the script and observe the countdown.

## Example Code

```python
import time
import winsound  # Windows only, for sound notification

def countdown_timer(duration):
    print(f"Countdown started for {duration} seconds.")

    for remaining_time in range(duration, 0, -1):
        print(f"Time remaining: {remaining_time} seconds")
        time.sleep(1)

    print("Countdown reached zero! Time's up!")

    # Sound notification (Windows only)
    winsound.Beep(1000, 1000)

# Get user input for the duration of the countdown
duration_input = int(input("Enter the duration of the countdown in seconds: "))

# Run the countdown timer
countdown_timer(duration_input)
```

Feel free to customize the countdown timer, add features, or modify the structure as you see fit. Contributors can use this document as a guide to implementing the countdown timer in Python.
