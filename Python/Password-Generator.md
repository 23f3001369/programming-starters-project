# Password Generator in Python

Welcome to the Password Generator project for Python! üêç

In this project, we'll create a simple password generator that generates random passwords based on user specifications. Let's get started!

## Project Overview

### Objective

Create a Python script that generates random passwords.

### Features

- Allow the user to specify the length of the password.
- Include options for including uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
- Generate a random password based on user specifications.

## Project Structure

Create a new Python script named `password_generator.py`.

## Instructions

1. **Get User Input:**
   - Prompt the user to enter the desired length of the password.

2. **Options for Password Complexity:**
   - Allow the user to choose whether to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters in the password.

3. **Generate Password:**
   - Generate a random password based on the user's specifications.
   - Ensure the password meets the desired length and includes the selected character types.

4. **Display Password:**
   - Print the generated password to the console.

5. **Run the Script:**
   - Run the script to generate passwords interactively.

## Example Code

```python
import random
import string

def generate_password():
    # Get user input for password length
    length = int(input("Enter the desired password length: "))

    # Define character sets based on user input
    lowercase_letters = string.ascii_lowercase
    uppercase_letters = string.ascii_uppercase
    digits = string.digits
    special_characters = string.punctuation

    # Combine character sets based on user choices
    character_set = ""
    character_set += lowercase_letters if input("Include lowercase letters? (y/n): ").lower() == 'y' else ''
    character_set += uppercase_letters if input("Include uppercase letters? (y/n): ").lower() == 'y' else ''
    character_set += digits if input("Include numbers? (y/n): ").lower() == 'y' else ''
    character_set += special_characters if input("Include special characters? (y/n): ").lower() == 'y' else ''

    # Generate password
    password = ''.join(random.choice(character_set) for _ in range(length))

    # Display the generated password
    print(f"Generated Password: {password}")

# Run the password generator
generate_password()
```
